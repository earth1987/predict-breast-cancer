    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**a) Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic) is a real world multivariate dataset containing 30 continuous features and a binary diagnosis target.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b) Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The categorical target is binary. Consequently, the problem will be approached as a binary classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "* No baseline model is available for benchmarking. The model will therefore be compared to a no-skill classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c) Technical requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "* In reality, predictions by the model would likely be generated for a batch of inputs on a recurring schedule (e.g. weekly) rather than processing each input data point individually in real time. Predictions would then nr stored in a database and made available to end users.\n",
    "\n",
    "* At this stage, the model will not be deployed. However, batch inference will be assumed. This has several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - there aren't low latency requirements (which place constraints on infrastructure and model complexity)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - scalable compute resources can be used (e.g. batch inference using parallelisation via Spark)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - predictions generated during batch inference can be analyzed and post processed before being seen by stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "**d) Data requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "* No further data collection is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "* No personal data is involved. Consequently there are no apparent legal/ethical constraints (e.g. GDPR)."
